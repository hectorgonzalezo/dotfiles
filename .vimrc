" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
" configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).

set number

" This enables relative line numbering mode. With both number and

" all other lines (above and below) are numbered relative to the current line.

" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
